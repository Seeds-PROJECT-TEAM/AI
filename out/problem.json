  "answer": "C",
  "rationale": "Choice C is correct. It's given that the function $f$ is defined by $f x=25 x+30$. Substituting 2 for $x$ in this equation yields $f 2=252+30$, which is equivalent to $f 2=50+30$, or $f 2=80$. Therefore, the value of $f x$ is 80 when $x=2$.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the value of 252 , not $252+30$.\nChoice B is incorrect. This is the value of $25+2+30$, not $252+30$.\nChoice $D$ is incorrect. This is the value of $25+302$, not $252+30$.",
